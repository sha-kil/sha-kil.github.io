I like solving problems in computer graphics, mesh processing and compute performance. I am a 3D software developer. I have a master’s degree from Concordia University in computer science. During my master’s programme, I worked at the Geometric Processing and Acquisition Lab where I worked several projects collaborating with industry. Previously, I’ve been employed by Promine, where I worked on 3D modeling and annotating mine models. Currently, I am working in web based 3D CAD software
